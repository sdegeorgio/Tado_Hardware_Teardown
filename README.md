# Tado Reverse Engineering
This repo contains all the information gathered whilst attempting to reverse engineer the Tado smart heating control system.
Head over to the [Tado Reverse Engineering Wiki](https://github.com/sdegeorgio/Tado_Hardware_Teardown/wiki) section of this repo for more details.

## Introduction
The Tado smart heating and hot water control system is a very good system however I was fed up with there being no solution to the poor coverage.  I tried placing the Internet gateway device in many different locations within my home but it would never connect to all devices at once.  There are two solutions I came up with:
1. Improve the RF range, or
2. Develop a repeater device
